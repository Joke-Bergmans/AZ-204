## [Introduction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/azure-event-grid/2-event-grid-overview)

> Azure Event Grid is a **serverless event broker**. It delivers events to subscriber destination and supports **filtering**, **retrying** and **multicasting**.

> Event Grid is a **resource provider**, it does not need provisioning, only registration:
> `az provider register --namespace Microsoft.EventGrid`

Concepts:

- **Events**: what
- **Event sources**: where
- **Topics**: endpoints to send events to
- **Event subscriptions**: endpoints to route events to handlers
- **Event handlers**: app/service handling events

### Events

> Events are the **smallest amount of data** that **fully describe an action** that took place in the system.

Events contain:

- **Common information**
  - Source
  - Timestamp
  - Unique identifier
- **Event specific information**
  - `data` property

### Event sources

> Event sources are **responsible for sending events** to Event Grid. Each source is related to one or more **event types**.

### Topics

> Topics are **collections of related events**. They provide **endpoints** where sources can send events. Subscribers subscribe to certain topics.

There are 2 types of topics:

- **System topics**
  - Built-in topics
  - Provided by Azure services
  - Topics are not visible in Azure subscription
  - Can only subscribed to its events
- **Custom topics**
  - Visible in Azure subscription

### Event subscriptions

> Subscriptions tell Event Grid **which events from the topic** you want to receive. You have to **provide an endpoint for handling** the event. Events to be send to the endpoint can be **filtered** by event type or subject pattern.

### Event handlers

> Event handlers are places where the events are sent. Event Grid follows different mechanisms to **guarantee the delivery** of the event. Handlers can be **Azure services** or custom **webhooks**.

## [Event schemas](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/azure-event-grid/3-event-grid-schema)

> Events follow schemas, either **Event Grid event schema** or **Cloud event schema**.

> Events are sent in an array, which can have a total size of 1MB. Operations are charged per 64KB.

### Event schema

```json
[
  {
    "topic": string, // not required, if included it must match ARM ID of the topic
    "subject": string,
    "id": string,
    "eventType": string,
    "eventTime": string,
    "data":{
      object-unique-to-each-publisher // not required
    },
    "dataVersion": string, // not required
    "metadataVersion": string // not required, if included it must match Event Grid Schema version
  }
]

// header content type
"content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8"
```

> Events to custom topics should have **subject values that are easily filtered** by subscribers.

### Cloud event schema

> CloudEvents is an open specification for describing event data.

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "type": "Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated",
  "source": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storage-account}",
  "id": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb54906e209",
  "time": "2019-11-18T15:13:39.4589254Z",
  "subject": "blobServices/default/containers/{storage-container}/blobs/{new-file}",
  "dataschema": "#",
  "data": {
    "api": "PutBlockList",
    "clientRequestId": "4c5dd7fb-2c48-4a27-bb30-5361b5de920a",
    "requestId": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb549000000",
    "eTag": "0x8D76C39E4407333",
    "contentType": "image/png",
    "contentLength": 30699,

    "sequencer": "000000000000000000000000000099240000000000c41c18",
    "storageDiagnostics": {
      "batchId": "681fe319-3006-00a8-0022-9e7cde000000"
    }
  }
}

// header content type
"content-type":"application/cloudevents+json; charset=utf-8"
```

## [Event delivery durability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/azure-event-grid/4-event-grid-delivery-retry)

> Event Grid provides **durable delivery**: it retries failed deliveries based on fixed **retry schedules** & **retry policies**. Because of this, events can arrive **out of order**.

### Retry schedule

> Event Grid decides if it should retry delivery based on the received error type. Events that are not retried will be **dead-lettered** or **dropped**.

Error codes that will not prompt a retry:

- **Azure Resources**
  - 400 Bad Request
  - 413 Request Entity Too Large
  - 403 Forbidden
- **Webhooks**
  - 400 Bad Request
  - 413 Request Entity Too Large
  - 403 Forbidden
  - 404 Not Found
  - 401 Unauthorized

> When retrying delivery, Event Grid waits 30 secs before queueing the event for retry. If a response should be received within 3 mins, Event Grid attempts to remove the event from the queue.

### Retry policy

The retry policy for subscriptions can be configured in 2 ways:

- **Max number of attempts**: 1-**30** tries
- **Event time-to-live**: 1-**1440** minutes

> Events are dropped if either limit is reached.

```powershell
az eventgrid event-subscription create \
  -g gridResourceGroup \
  --topic-name <topic_name> \
  --name <event_subscription_name> \
  --endpoint <endpoint_URL> \
  --max-delivery-attempts 18
```

### Output batching

> Event Grid can be configured per subscription to **batch events for delivery**. Delivery won't be delayed to create max size batches.

Batch delivery has 2 settings:

- **Max events per batch**: 1-5000 events
- **Preferred batch size (KB)**
  - Single events can exceed size limit

### Delayed delivery

> Event Grid will delay event delivery if an endpoint experiences delivery failures.

### Dead-letter events

> **Dead-lettering events** means sending undelivered events to a **storage account**. This is turned off by default.

Events will be dead-lettered when either:

- TTL period expired
- Number of retries was reached

### Custom delivery properties

> Event subscriptions allow you to set custom HTTP headers included when delivering events.

Custom headers are supported for these destinations:

- **Webhooks**
- **Azure Service Bus topics & queues**
- **Azure Event Hubs**
- **Relay Hybrid Connections**

## [Access control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/azure-event-grid/5-authorize-access-event-grid)

> Event Grid uses **Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)** to give access to users.

Built-in roles:

- **Event Grid Subscription Reader**: read subscriptions
- **Event Grid Subscription Contributor**: manage subscriptions
- **Event Grid Contributor**: manage resources
- **Event Grid Data Sender**: send events to topics

### Event subscription permissions

> Sending events to event handlers requires **write access (Microsoft.EventGrid/EventSubscriptions/Write permission)** to that resource (not applicable for webhooks).

The resource that needs this permission depends on the type of topc:

- **System topics**
  - Resource that publishes the events
  - `/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/{resource-provider}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}`
- **Custom topics**
  - Event grid topic
  - `/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/{topic-name}`

## [Webhooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/azure-event-grid/6-webhook-event-delivery)

> When registering a webhook as an event handler, you first need to pass a **validation check** to verify that you are the owner of the endpoint.

Azure handles this validation automatically for these services:

- **Azure Logic Apps** with Event Grid Connector
- **Azure Automation** via webhook
- **Azure Functions** with Event Grid Trigger

### Endpoint validation

Event Grid supports 2 ways of validating subscriptions:

- **Synchronous handshake**
  - Event Grid sends **subscription validation event**
  - Data of event contains `validationCode`
  - Handler returns this code in the response
- **Asynchronous handshake**
  - When response can't return code
  - Data of event contains `validationUrl`
  - **Url must receive GET request** within 5 mins
  - Subscription provisioning state will be `AwaitingManualAction` until verified
  - Webhook must also return 200 code

## [Event filtering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/azure-event-grid/7-event-grid-filtering)

Event subscriptions have 3 options for filtering events:

- **Event types**
- **Event subject**
- **Advanced fields & operators**

### Event type filtering

```json
"filter": {
  "includedEventTypes": [
    "Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteFailure",
    "Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteSuccess"
  ]
}
```

### Event subject filtering

```json
"filter": {
  "subjectBeginsWith": "/blobServices/default/containers/mycontainer/log",
  "subjectEndsWith": ".jpg"
}
```

### Advanced filtering

```json
"filter": {
  "advancedFilters": [
    {
      "operatorType": "NumberGreaterThanOrEquals",
      "key": "Data.Key1",
      "value": 5
    },
    {
      "operatorType": "StringContains",
      "key": "Subject",
      "values": ["container1", "container2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

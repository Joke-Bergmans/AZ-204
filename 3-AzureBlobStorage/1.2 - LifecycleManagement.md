## [Redundancy options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-azure-blob-storage/5-azure-storage-redundancy)

> Azure Storage stores **multiples copies** of data to protect it from hardware failures, network/power outages, natural disasters, ...

### Primary region redundancy

> Data is **always replicated 3 times** in primary region.

2 options for how data is replicated:

- **Locally redundant storage** (LRS): copied sync within single physical location
- **Zone-redundant storage** (ZRS): copied sync across 3 Azure availability zones in primary region

### Secondary region redundancy

> For high durability, data can additionally be copied to a secondary region.

2 options for how data is replicated:

- **Geo-redundant storage** (GRS):
  1. Sync LRS
  2. Copies async to single physical location in secondary region
  3. Sync LRS in new physical location
- **Geo-zone-redundant storage** (GZRS):
  1. Sync ZRS
  2. Copies async to single physical location in secondary region
  3. Sync LRS in new physical location

> Data is **always accessed from the primary region**. Secondary read access can be set up by using the **Read-access Geo-(zone-)redundant storage** replication strategy.

## [Introduction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-azure-app-service/2-azure-app-service)

> **Azure App Service** is an HTTP-based service for hosting web apps, REST API's and mobile backends

- Built-in auto scale support
- CI/CD support
- Deployment slots
- Linux support

## [App Service plans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-azure-app-service/3-azure-app-service-plans)

> App Service plan defines **compute resources** that can be used by web apps

### Configuration
- Region
- Number of VM instances
- Size of VM intances
- Pricing tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, PremiumV1/V2/V3, Isolated)
  - **Shared compute**: share resources with other customers (Free/Shared)
  - **Dedicated compute**: runs on dedicated VM instances, higher tier => more instances available for scaling (Basic, Standard, Premium)
  - **Isolated**: runs VM instances on **Azure Virtual Networks**, max scale-out capabilities => network & compute isolation (Isolated)
  - **Consumption**: only for function apps, scales dynamically based on workload

### Running and scaling

- **Free & Shared**: shared VM instances, can't scale out
- Other plans: 
  - 1 app runs on **all VM instances**
  - multiple apps (same plan) **share same VM instances**
  - multiple deployment slots **share same VM instances**
  - diagnostic logs, backups or WebJobs also use these VM instances

> App Service plan = **scale unit**
> - 5 configured VMs => all apps in plan run on 5 instances
> - autoscaling config => all apps scale out together
> 
*App Service plan can be scaled up/down anytime: change pricing tier*

### Isolating apps

Only isolate an app to a separate App Service plan when:
- App is resource intensive
- App needs to be scaled independently
- App needs resources in different location

## [Deploying](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-azure-app-service/4-deploy-code-to-app-service) 

### Automated deployment

- Azure DevOps
- GitHub
- Bitbucket

### Manual deployment

- Git
- CLI: `az webapp up`
- Zip deploy
- FTP/FTPS
  
### Deployment slots

> Deployment slots are live apps with different host names. Slots are often used to have separate staging/production slots that can be swapped easily to **eliminate downtime**. (Standard/Premium/Isolated tiers)

## [Authentication & Authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-azure-app-service/5-authentication-authorization-app-service)

- Azure provides out-of-the-box authentication
- Built into platform, no code required
- Integrate providers 

### Identity providers

| Provider | Sign-in endpoint| Documentation|
|---|---|---|
|Microsoft Identity Platform|`/.auth/login/aad`|[App Service Microsoft Identity Platform login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad)|
|Facebook|`/.auth/login/facebook`|[App Service Facebook login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-facebook)|
|Google|`/.auth/login/google`|[App Service Google login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-google)|
|Twitter|`/.auth/login/twitter`|[App Service Twitter login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-twitter)|
|OpenID Connect providers|`/.auth/login/<providerName>`|[App Service OpenID Connect login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-openid-connect)|

### How it works

> Authentication module runs in same sandbox as app, every request passes through

Authentication module handles:
- User authentication with specified provider
- Validation, storage and refresh of tokens
- Session management
- Injection into request headers

### Authentication flow

Flow varies depending on if provider SDK is used (API's) or not (web pages)

| Authentication Step | Without provider SDK | With provider SDK|
|---|---|---|
|Sign in |Redirects client to `/.auth/login/<provider>`. |Client code signs user in directly with provider's SDK and receives an authentication token. |
|Post-authentication|Provider redirects client to `/.auth/login/<provider>/callback`.|Client code posts token from provider to `/.auth/login/<provider>` for validation.|
|Established authenticated session|App Service adds authenticated cookie to response.|App Service returns its own authentication token to client code.|
|Servce authentication content|Client includes authentication cookie in subsequent requests (automatically handled by browser).|Client code presents authentication token in `X-ZUMO-AUTH` header (automatically handled by Mobile Apps client SDKs).|

### Authorization

Configure different behaviour for App Service: 
- **Allow unauthenticated requests**: request handling done by app code
- **Require authentication**: reject all unauthenticated traffix => redirect 

## [Networking features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-azure-app-service/6-network-features)

> Control inbound & outbound network traffic

### Multi-tenant networking features

- **Inbound features**
  - App-assigned addresses
  - Access restriction
  - Service endpoints
  - Private endpoints
- **Outbound features**
  - Hybrid connections
  - Gateway-required virtual network integration
  - Virtual network integration

### Outbound addresses

> Switching pricing tiers will result in different outbound addresses

Outbound addresses are listed in app properties (`outboundIpAddresses`/`possibleOutboundIpAddresses`)

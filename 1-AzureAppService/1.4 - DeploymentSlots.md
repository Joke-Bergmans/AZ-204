## [Staging environments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/understand-app-service-deployment-slots/2-app-service-staging-environments)

> **Deployment slots** are live apps with their own host names. **App content** and **configurations** can be swapped between (production) slots.

Benefits:

- **Validate app changes** in staging deployment slot
- Deploying to different slot before swapping to production slot warms up slot instances, which **eliminates downtime**
  - Auto swap can be configured
- After swapping, last stable production is still available to **swap back in case of emergency**

_Each tier (Standard, Premium, Isolated) supports different number of deployment slots._

## [Slot swapping](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/understand-app-service-deployment-slots/3-app-service-slot-swapping)

### Swapping process

Following steps are executed when swapping slots:

1. **Apply settings** from target slot on all instances of source slot:

   - Slot-specific app settings and connection settings
   - Continuous deployment settings
   - App Service authentication settings

2. Wait for every source instance to **restart**, revert all changes on failure

3. Trigger **local cache initialization** by making HTTP request to root ("/") on each source slot instance and wait for response (if local cache is enabled)

4. Trigger **Application Initiation** by making HTTP request to root ("/") on each source slot instance, response = warmed up (if auto swap is enabled with custom warm-up)

5. Swap slots by **switching routing rules** when all source slot instances are warmed up
6. Apply all settings and restart source slot (now has pre-swapped app from target slot)

> Make sure to always use production slot as target, as target slot remains online during this process

### Configuration after swapping

- **Not slot specific settings** (will be swapped)
  - General settings
  - App settings (can be configured to stick to slot)
  - Connection settings (can be configured be stick to slot)
  - Handler mappings
  - Public certificates
  - WebJobs content
  - Hybrid connections
  - Virtual Network integration
  - Service endpoints
  - Azure Content Delivery Network
- **Slot specific settings** (will stay)
  - Publishing endpoints
  - Custom domain names
  - Non-public certificates and TSL/SSL settings
  - Scale settings
  - WebJobs schedulers
  - IP restrictions
  - Always On
  - Diagnostic log settings
  - Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

> To make **all** settings swappable, add app setting `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_PRESERVE_DEFAULT_STICKY_SLOT_SETTINGS` in every slot of the app and set it to `0`/`false`.

> To make **app setting** or **connection setting** slot specific, go to configuration page for that slot. Edit setting and check `Deployment slot setting`.

## [Swap deployment slots](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/understand-app-service-deployment-slots/4-swap-deployment-slots)

### Manual swap

1. `Deployment slots > Swap`
2. Select desired source and target slots and verify configuration changes
3. Either **swap** or **swap with preview**
   - Swap with preview will stop after step 1
   - Verify changes in source slot at `https://<app_name>-<source-slot-name>.azurewebsites.net`
   - Complete swap or cancel

### Auto swap

> When auto swap is enabled on a slot, App Service automatically swaps this slot with production every time a code change is pushed.

To configure, select desired deployment slot and then `Configuration > General settings > Auto swap enabled`

### Custom warm-up

- Configure `web.config` to add custom initialization actions

  ```xml
  <system.webServer>
      <applicationInitialization>
          <add initializationPage="/" hostName="[app hostname]" />
          <add initializationPage="/Home/About" hostName="[app hostname]" />
      </applicationInitialization>
  </system.webServer>
  ```

- Configure app settings
  - `WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_PATH` to specify ping path (default = /)
  - `WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_STATUSES` to specify valid HTTP responses (default = all)

### Rolling back and monitoring

Same slots can be **swapped again** to roll production back to it's previous (valid) state. **Activity log** contains information about all swap operations (query `Swap Web App Slots`).

## [Route traffic in App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/understand-app-service-deployment-slots/5-route-traffic-app-service)

> By default all requests to production (`http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net`) are routed to the production slot. Traffic can be **rerouted to different slots** to try out new features without releasing them to production.

### Automatic routing

1. `App resource page > Deployment slots`
2. Specify percentage in Traffic column that will randomly be routed to this slot (default = 0%)

_Client browser will have `x-ms-routing-name` cookie in HTTP headers indicating which slot the session is pinned to (self=production)_

### Manual routing

Change hyperlinks to include `x-ms-routing-name=slot-name`

```html
<a href="<webappname>.azurewebsites.net/?x-ms-routing-name=self"
  >Go back to production app</a
>
<!-- or -->
<a href="<webappname>.azurewebsites.net/?x-ms-routing-name=staging"
  >Go to beta app</a
>
```

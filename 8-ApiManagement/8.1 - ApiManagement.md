## [Introduction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-api-management/2-api-management-overview)

> API Management contains of an **API gateway**, a **management plane** and a **developer portal**.

- **API gateway**
  - Endpoint that accepts API calls and routes them to backends
  - Verifies API keys & credentials
  - Enforces usage quotas & rate limits
  - Transforms requests & responses
  - Caches responses
  - Emits logs, metrics & traces
- **Management plane**
  - Administrative interface
  - Provisioning & configuration
  - Define/import API schemas
  - Package APIs into products
  - Setup policies
  - Manage users
  - Analytics
- **Developer portal**
  - Automatically generated website with documentation
  - Call APIs with interactive console
  - Create account & subscribe to get API keys
  - Analytics for own usage
  - Download API definitions
  - Manage API keys

### Products

> Developers access APIs through **products**. They have one or more APIs and are configured with a title, description and terms of use. 

> Products can be **open** or **protected**. Protected products can only be accessed with a **subscription**. Subscription approval is configured at product level.

### Groups

> Groups are used to **manage visibility of products**. 

There are 3 immutable system groups:
- **Administrators**
- **Developers**
  - Authenticated developer portal users
- **Guests**
  - Unauthenticated developer portal users
  - Can be granted read-only access

### Developers

> Developers are user accounts. They can be **created or invited** to join by **administrators**, or they can **sign up from the Developer portal**. Each developer is a member of one or more groups, and can subscribe to products in those groups.

### Policies

> Policies are statements that are **executed on requests/responses**. They can be applied at **different scopes** (global, product, API, API operation).

## [Gateways](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-api-management/3-api-gateways)

> API Management gateway (data plane) is responsible for **proxying API requests** from clients to services, **applying policies** to requests and responses, and **collecting telemetry**.

Gateways can be **managed** or **self-hosted**
- **Managed gateway**
  - Default gateway component 
  - Deployed for every instance
  - All API traffic flows through Azure
- **Self-hosted gateway**
  - Optional
  - Containerized version of default managed gateway
  - Hybrid/multicloud scenarios

## [Management policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-api-management/4-api-management-policies)

> Policies are **XML statements** applied inside gateway. They can **apply changes to inbound requests & outbound responses**. 

### Configuration

> Policy definitions are devided into **inboud**, **backend**, **outbound** & **on-error**.

```xml
<policies>
  <inbound>
    <!-- statements to be applied to the request go here -->
  </inbound>
  <backend>
    <!-- statements to be applied before the request is forwarded to 
         the backend service go here -->
  </backend>
  <outbound>
    <!-- statements to be applied to the response go here -->
  </outbound>
  <on-error>
    <!-- statements to be applied if there is an error condition go here -->
  </on-error>
</policies>
```

### Policy expressions

> Policy expressions are **C# statements** that can be used as **attribute values** or **text values**.

- **Single statement**: `@(expression)`
- **Multi-statement code block**: `@{expression}` with return value
  

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <base />
        <set-header name="x-request-context-data" exists-action="override">
            <value>@(context.User.Id)</value>
            <value>@(context.Deployment.Region)</value>
      </set-header>
    </inbound>
</policies>
```

### Different scopes

> Policies can be configured at different scopes. **All configured policies will be applied**. The **ordering** of these combined policies can be **customized** by using `<base/>`.

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <cross-domain />
        <base /> <!-- apply all broader scope policies -->
        <find-and-replace from="xyz" to="abc" />
    </inbound>
</policies>
```

### Filtering response content

> Policies can be used to filter data elements out of the response payload under certain conditions.

```xml
<policies>
  <inbound>
    <base />
  </inbound>
  <backend>
    <base />
  </backend>
  <outbound>
    <base />
    <choose>
      <when condition="@(context.Response.StatusCode == 200 && context.Product.Name.Equals("Starter"))">
        <set-body>
          @{
            var response = context.Response.Body.As<JObject>();
            foreach (var key in new [] {"minutely", "hourly", "daily", "flags"}) 
            {
                response.Property(key).Remove();
            }
            return response.ToString();
          }
    </set-body>
      </when>
    </choose>    
  </outbound>
  <on-error>
    <base />
  </on-error>
</policies>
```


## [Advanced policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-api-management/5-create-advanced-policies)

### Control flow

```xml
<choose>
    <when condition="Boolean expression | Boolean constant">
        <!— one or more policy statements to be applied if the above condition is true  -->
    </when>
    <when condition="Boolean expression | Boolean constant">
        <!— one or more policy statements to be applied if the above condition is true  -->
    </when>
    <otherwise>
        <!— one or more policy statements to be applied if none of the above conditions are true  -->
</otherwise>
</choose>
```

### Forwarding requests

> `forward-request` forwards incoming requests to the configured backend service. When this policy is removed, outbound policies will be evaluated immediately after completion of the inbound policies.

```xml
<forward-request timeout="time in seconds" follow-redirects="true | false"/>
```

### Limit concurrency

> `limit-concurrency` stops enclosed policies from being executed by more than a number of requests. New requests will immediately receive a *429 Too Many Requests*.

```xml
<limit-concurrency key="expression" max-count="number">
        <!— nested policy statements -->
</limit-concurrency>
```

### Logging to Event Hub


```xml
<log-to-eventhub logger-id="id of the logger entity" partition-id="index of the partition where messages are sent" partition-key="value used for partition assignment">
  Expression returning a string to be logged
</log-to-eventhub>
```

### Mocking responses


```xml
<mock-response status-code="code" content-type="media type"/>
```

### Retrying

> `retry` will keep executing its child policies until condition becomes `false` or the `count` is exhausted.

```xml
<retry
    condition="boolean expression or literal"
    count="number of retry attempts"
    interval="retry interval in seconds"
    max-interval="maximum retry interval in seconds"
    delta="retry interval delta in seconds"
    first-fast-retry="boolean expression or literal">
        <!-- One or more child policies. No restrictions -->
</retry>
```

### Returning responses

```xml
<return-response response-variable-name="existing context variable">
  <set-header/>
  <set-body/>
  <set-status/>
</return-response>
```

## [Securing with subscriptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-api-management/6-secure-access-api-subscriptions)

> APIs can be secured by using **subscription keys**. Developers need a valid subscription key in their request headers/query parameters to access API endpoints.

There are 3 subscription scopes:
- **All APIs**: every API accessible from gateway
- **Single API**: single API and all of its endpoints
- **Product**: configured product

> Every subscription has 2 keys. Keys can be regenerated at any time.

### Using subscription keys

> Applications can only access protected endpoints by including a valid key in the request header **`Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`** or as query string **`subscription-key`**. 

```powershell
curl --header "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <key string>" https://<apim gateway>.azure-api.net/api/path
curl https://<apim gateway>.azure-api.net/api/path?subscription-key=<key string>
```

## [Securing with certificates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-api-management/7-secure-access-api-certificates)


> Certificates can be used for **TLS mutual authentication**. Gateways can be configured to only allow requests with certificates with specific properties.

Policies can check these properties:
- **Certificate Authority (CA)**
- **Thumbprint**
- **Subject**
- **Expiration date**

*Consumption tier instances must explicitly enable the use of client certificates.* 

### Policies

```xml
<policies>
  <inbound>
    <base />
    <!-- check hardcoded thumbprint -->
    <choose>
        <when condition="@(context.Request.Certificate == null || context.Request.Certificate.Thumbprint != "desired-thumbprint")" >
            <return-response>
                <set-status code="403" reason="Invalid client certificate" />
            </return-response>
        </when>
    </choose>
    <!-- check against certificates uploaded in API management-->
    <choose>
        <when condition="@(context.Request.Certificate == null || !context.Request.Certificate.Verify()  || !context.Deployment.Certificates.Any(c => c.Value.Thumbprint == context.Request.Certificate.Thumbprint))" >
            <return-response>
                <set-status code="403" reason="Invalid client certificate" />
            </return-response>
        </when>
    </choose>

    <!-- check issues & subject -->
    <choose>
        <when condition="@(context.Request.Certificate == null || context.Request.Certificate.Issuer != "trusted-issuer" || context.Request.Certificate.SubjectName.Name != "expected-subject-name")" >
            <return-response>
                <set-status code="403" reason="Invalid client certificate" />
            </return-response>
        </when>
    </choose>
  </inbound>
  <!-- ... -->
</policies>
```

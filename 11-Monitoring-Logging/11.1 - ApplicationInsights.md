## [Introduction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-app-performance/2-application-insights-overview)

> Application Insights is an Azure Monitor extension that provides **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**. It is useful for:
>
> - **Proactively** monitor app **performance**
> - **Reactively** review app **execution data** to determine incident cause
> - Storing trace **logging data**

### Features

- **Live Metrics**: observe activity in real time
- **Availability**: probe external endpoints to test availability
- **GitHub/Azure DevOps integration**
- **Usage**
- **Smart Detection**: automatic failure & anomaly detection through proactive telemetry analysis
- **Application Map**: top-down view of app architecture with visual references to health & responsiveness
- **Distributed Tracing**: search & visualize end-to-end flows of execution/transactions

### Data

- **Request rates, response times & failure rates**
  - Most popular pages
  - Most popular times of day
  - User locations
  - Best perfoming pages
- **Dependency rates, response times & failure rates**
  - Problems with external services
- **Exceptions**
  - Drill into stack traces & related requests
- **Page views & load performance**
- **AJAX calls**
- **User & session counts**
- **Performance counters**
  - CPU
  - Memory
  - Network usage
- **Host diagnostics**
- **Diagnostic trace logs**
- **Custom events & metrics**

### Getting started

- **At run time**
  - Already deployed apps
  - No code updates
- **At development time**
  - Add Application Insights to code
  - Customize telemetry collection
- **Instrument web pages**
  - Page view telemetry
  - Client-side telemetry
- **Analyze mobile app usage**
  - Integration with Visual Studio App Center
- **Availability tests**
  - Ping endpoints regularly

## [Metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-app-performance/3-logs-based-metrics)

There are 2 kinds of metrics:

- **Log-based metrics**
  - Translated into Kusto queries from stored events
  - More dimensions
  - Data analysis
  - Ad-hoc diagnostics
- **Standard metrics**
  - Pre-aggregated time series
  - Aggregated during collection
  - Better performance at query time
  - Dashboarding
  - Real-time alerting

### Log-based metrics

> Event logs can be **automatically collected** from auto-instrumentation or **manually sent** from the code.

- Logging **complete sets of events**
  - Great analytical & diagnostic value
  - Large volume of data
- **Telemetry reduction techniques**
  - Sampling & filtering
  - Reduce amount of data
  - **Reduce metric accuracy**

### Standard metrics

> Pre-aggregated metrics are stored as **time-series with key properties**, not as individual events.

- Fast data retrieval
- Less compute power
- Allows for **real-time alerting**
- **Not affected by sampling/filtering**

## [App instrumentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-app-performance/4-app-instrumentation)

> Application Insights is enabled through either **auto-instrumentation** or by adding the **SDK** to the app code.

### Auto-instrumentation

> Auto-instrumentation requires **no developer investment** and has **no overhead related to SDK updates**. Source code access is not required.

- Enable & configure agent
- Not supported by every service

### Application Insights SDK

SDK is only necessary for these use cases:

- **Custom events & metrics**
- Control over **flow of telemetry**
- Auto-instrumentation is not available

Apps **don't have to be hosted in Azure** to use the SDK.

### OpenCensus

> OpenCensus is an open source, vendor-agnostic distribution of libraries to provide metrics collection & distributed tracing for services.

## [Availability test](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-app-performance/5-availability-tests)

> Application Insights can **send web requests** at **regular intervals** from **different locations**. It can **alert** you if the app isn't responding or is responding too slowly.

- Any HTTP/HTTPS endpoint
  - Even third-party
- Max 100 availability tests per Application Insights resource

### Types

There are 3 types of availability tests:

- **URL ping**
  - Uses public DNS infrastructure
  - Validate if endpoint is responding
  - Measure response performance
  - Custom success criteria
- **Standard test**
  - Similar to URL ping
  - Includes SSL certificate validity
  - Custom HTTP verbs
  - Custom HTTP headers
  - Custom request data
- **Custom TrackAvailability test**
  - Custom app to run tests
  - Test multi-request or **authentication scenarios**
  - Send results to Application Insights with `TrackAvailability()`

## [Application map](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-app-performance/6-application-map)

> Application Map is a **visual representation** of **components & dependencies** of an app; with health KPI & alerts status. It can help spot performance bottlenecks or failure hotspots.

### Components

> Components are **independently deployable** parts of your application.

- Found by following **HTTP dependency calls** made **between servers with Application Insights**
  - Can be separate Application Insights instrumentation keys
- **Progressive discovery**
  - Queries are triggered on first load of Application Map
  - Manually refresh with `Update map components` button
  - Only needed when components are **not within the same Application Insights resource**
- Use **cloud role name property** as identifier

## [Benefits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-azure-cosmos-db/2-cosmos-db-benefits)

> Azure Cosmos DB is a **fully managed** NoSQL database designed to provide **low latency**, **elastic scalability**, **well-defined semantics** and **high availability**.

### Global distrubution

> Databases can be configured to be globally distributed and available in **any Azure region**.

> Every region supports write and reads because of the **multi-master protocol**.

- Unlimited elastic read & write scalability
- 99.999% availability
- Near real-time reads & writes

Data replication with guaranteed **consistency levels** (configurable)

## [Resource hierarchy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-azure-cosmos-db/3-cosmos-db-resource-hierarchy)

### Accounts

> Azure Cosmos DB accounts are the **fundamental unit** of global distribution, high availability and scalability.

- Contains unique DNS name
- Add/remove regions for global distribution
- Partitioning of containers with logical partition key

### Databases

> Azure Cosmos DB databases are the **unit of management** (namespaces) for sets of containers.

### Containers

> Azure Cosmos DB containers are the **unit of scalability** for provisioned throughput and storage.

- Horizontally partitioned and replicated
- **Items** are automatically grouped into **logical partitions**
- **Logical partitions** are distributed across **physical partitions**
- Throughput is **evenly distributed** across physical partitions

#### Throughput

There are 2 throughput modes:

- **Dedicated provisioned throughput**
  - Throughput provisioned on a container is **reserved** for that container only
- **Shared provisioned throughput**
  - Provisioned throughput is **shared** among all containers in the database (except dedicated containers ^)

### Items

> Azure Cosmos DB items can have **arbitrary schemas**. They are **automatically indexed**.

## [Consistency levels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-azure-cosmos-db/4-cosmos-db-consistency-levels-overview)

There are 5 consistency levels:

- **Strong**
- **Bounded staleness**
- **Session**
- **Consistent prefix**
- **Eventual**

![Consistency levels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/explore-azure-cosmos-db/media/five-consistency-levels.png)

> Higher consistency comes with **performance tradeoffs**.

> Consistency levels are configured on **account level** and apply to all databases and containers.

### [Strong consistency](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-azure-cosmos-db/5-choose-cosmos-db-consistency-level)

> Clients are guaranteed to **read the latest comitted write**.

![Strong consistency](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/media/consistency-levels/strong-consistency.gif)

### Bounded staleness consistency

> Reads are guaranteed to **lag behind at most** K versions (writes) or T time intervals. K & T can be configured.

![Bounded staleness](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/media/consistency-levels/bounded-staleness-consistency.gif)

### Session consistency

> Single client reads are guaranteed **read-your-writes** and **write-follows-reads**.

![Session consistency](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/media/consistency-levels/session-consistency.gif)

### Consistent prefix consistency

> Reads are guaranteed to **never see out-of-order writes**.

![Consistent prefix consistency](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/media/consistency-levels/consistent-prefix.gif)

### Eventual consistency

> No ordering guarantee for reads. Replicas will **converge eventually**.

![Eventual consistency](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/media/consistency-levels/eventual-consistency.gif)

## [Supported APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-azure-cosmos-db/6-cosmos-db-supported-apis)

> APIs allow applications to treat Azure Cosmos DB as if it were **another database technology**. Data modelling varies for each API.

### NoSQL (Core/SQL)

- Native
- Document structure
- Best e2e experience
- SQL syntax

### MongoDB

- Document structure
- BSON format

### PostgreSQL

- Managed service for running PostgreSQL

### Apache Cassandra

- Column-oriented

### Apache Gremlin

- Data stored as edges & vertices
- Graph queries

### Table

- Azure Table Storage
- Key/value format

## [Request units](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-azure-cosmos-db/7-cosmos-db-request-units)

> **Throughput** is **provisioned** to ensure sufficient system resources at all times.

> Cost of database operations is expressed in **request units (RUs)**, representing system resources required for the operation.

Operation costs (RUs) can be reduced by **query optimization**, **partitioning** and **indexing**.

### Account modes

> The way RUs get charged depends on the type of Azure Cosmos DB account.

- **Provisioned throughput**
  - Provision number of RUs per second
  - Scaling by increasing/decreasing RUs
- **Serverless**
  - No provisioning
  - Billed at the end of billing period for consumed RUs
- **Autoscale**
  - Automatically scale throughput based on usage
  - Doesn't affect availability, latency, throughput or performance
